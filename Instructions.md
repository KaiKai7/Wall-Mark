#    Instructions

##  Overview

###  Wall Mark is a simple app that will create a link to view articles behind paywalls

The app uses pre existing sites from the web, to create a link to read articles.

You can use the sites already listed in the app or temporarily change to a custom one that you have found.

The link to read the article is copied to the clipboard when the corrosponding button is pressed.

Link can be shared to a browser to view, no proprietary viewer or account to view.

You dont need an account for this app, and the app does not use the information entered by the user.

URL's created can be shared and viewed by other's.

###  Lite version versus the Paid version

The Lite version of Wall Mark is an ad sponsored version of the app. 

A version with ads helps me as a developer, and also enables me to offer a version free of charge.

The Paid version does not have ads and is the full version.

New features may be offered in the paid version in the future.


## Instructions For Use

### Step 1

Enter or paste the article link in the URL field.

If you are manually entering a url, then make sure to use the full url.

For example, make sure to include the complete url like this https://example.com.

Typing only example.com will result in an error due to improper formatting.

### Step 2

* Decide which link you will use from the six listed. 

* Then press the "copy" button directly to the right of the link chosen.

* Pressing the "copy" button will copy the created link to the clipboard.

* You can also now share this link to other apps.

### Step 3

* The easiest way to now use this link to view the paywalled article, is to share to your browser.

* Sharing to the browser will then attempt to open the article with the link chosen.

* If the link was successful, you will be able to view the article.

* If the link was not successful, then go back to the app and try one of the other five remaining links.

* If trying all available link options the site does not open correctly, then it is probably due to the way the site is coded and Wall Mark will not work.
  

## Adding or Changing Links

The links that are listed in the app can be changed or edited.

This means that if the site listed becomes inactive, the link can be changed.

The changes you make are not persistant and will revert back to the default when the app is restarted. This way you do not have to remember what it used to be if you wished to revert.

If you find better links than the ones listed, then feel free to change them to your liking. And although they are not persistant, any links found no longer working will be removed and replaced on a version change.

A separate page has been created to list the default sites found in the app, as well as to list new ones as found.

If you have or find other working links, please notifiy me so that they can be added to or replace existing links.
