##  Overview

###  Wall Mark is a simple app that will create a link to view articles behind paywalls.

The app uses pre existing sites from the web, to create a link to read articles.

You can use the sites already listed in the app or change to one that you have found.

The link to read the article is copied to the clipboard when the corrosponding button is pressed.

Link can be shared to a browser to view, no proprietary viewer or account to view.

You dont need an account for this app, and the app does not use the information entered by the user.


## Instructions For Use

### Step 1

Enter or paste the article link in the URL field.

### Step 2

* Decide which link you will use from the six listed. 

* Then press the "go" button directly to the right of the link chosen.

* Pressing the "go" button will copy the created link to the clipboard.

* You can also now share this link.

### Step 3

* The easiest way to now use this link to view the paywalled article, is to share to your browser.

* Sharing to the browser will then attempt to open the article with the link chosen.

* If the link was successful, you will be able to view the article.

* If the link was not successful, then go back to the app and try one of the other five remaining links.
