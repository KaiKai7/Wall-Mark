#    Help
###  Wall Mark is a simple app that will create a link to view articles behind paywalls.

The app uses pre existing sites from the web, to create a link to read articles.

You can use the sites already listed in the app or change to one that you have found.

The link to read the article is copied to the clipboard when the corrosponding button is pressed.

Link can be shared to a browser to view, no proprietary viewer or account to view.

You dont need an account for this app, and the app does not use the information entered by the user.
